# MCP POSIX compatible system (Linux, BSD, macOS) SSH Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants to run commands and access files on remote POSIX compatible system (Linux, BSD, macOS) systems via SSH. This server provides a secure way for AI models to perform system administration tasks, troubleshoot issues, execute commands, and read configuration files on remote POSIX compatible system (Linux, BSD, macOS) machines.

## Example Use Cases

This MCP server enables LLMs to act as intelligent system administrators, capable of discovering and troubleshooting complex issues across your infrastructure. Here are some powerful examples:

### üîç **Automated Issue Discovery**
- **"My web application is responding slowly"** ‚Üí LLM checks system resources (`top`, `free`, `df`), examines web server logs, analyzes network connections, and identifies the bottleneck
- **"Users can't log in"** ‚Üí LLM investigates authentication logs (`/var/log/auth.log`), checks service status (`systemctl status sshd`), verifies user accounts, and diagnoses the root cause
- **"Database queries are timing out"** ‚Üí LLM examines database logs, checks connection pools, analyzes slow query logs, and monitors system resources to pinpoint performance issues

### üõ†Ô∏è **Intelligent Troubleshooting**
- **Multi-server correlation**: LLM can simultaneously check logs and metrics across web servers, databases, and load balancers to trace issues through your entire stack
- **Configuration analysis**: Automatically read and analyze config files (`nginx.conf`, `my.cnf`, etc.) to identify misconfigurations or optimization opportunities
- **Dependency tracking**: Follow service dependencies by checking systemd units, network connections, and process relationships

### üöÄ **Operational Efficiency**
- **Deployment verification**: After deployments, automatically verify services are running, configurations are correct, and applications are responding properly
- **Incident response**: During outages, quickly gather diagnostic information from multiple systems to accelerate root cause analysis
- **Documentation generation**: Automatically document system configurations, installed packages, and service dependencies

## Features

- **Five Powerful Tools**:
  - Local command execution for SSH troubleshooting
  - Remote SSH command execution (standard user permissions)
  - Remote SSH command execution with sudo support
  - File copying with rsync (preserves attributes, creates backups)
  - Patch application over SSH (apply diffs to remote files)
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Prevent commands from blocking indefinitely with per-command timeout settings
- **Public Key Discovery**: List available public keys from the local `~/.ssh` directory.
- **Flexible Authentication**: Uses your existing SSH configuration and keys
- **User Specification**: Option to specify which user to run commands as
- **Secure**: Leverages SSH's built-in security features
- **Expert Instructions**: Comes with built-in system administrator persona
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Clear error messages for connection and execution issues

    env:
      RUST_LOG: info
```

## SSH Configuration

Before using this MCP server, ensure your SSH is properly configured:

### 1. SSH Key Setup

Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Copy your public key to the remote server:
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@remote-host
```

### 2. SSH Config File

Create or edit `~/.ssh/config` to simplify connections:
```
Host myserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User myuser
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### 3. Test SSH Connection

Verify you can connect without a password:
```bash
ssh myserver whoami
```

### 4. Custom Identity Files

The MCP server supports specifying custom private key files through the `private_key` parameter. This is useful when:

- You have multiple SSH keys for different servers or environments
- You need to use a specific key that's not the default (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
- You're managing multiple remote systems with different authentication requirements

**Key Features:**
- **Default Behavior**: Uses `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` if no `private_key` is specified
- **Tilde Expansion**: Supports `~` for home directory (e.g., `~/.ssh/my_key`)
- **Absolute Paths**: Supports full paths (e.g., `/home/user/.ssh/production_key`)
- **Relative Paths**: Supports relative paths from current working directory

**Examples:**
```json
// Using default key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
{
  "command": "ls",
  "remote_host": "server1"
}

// Using custom key with tilde expansion
{
  "command": "ls",
  "remote_host": "server2",
  "private_key": "~/.ssh/production_key"
}

// Using absolute path
{
  "command": "ls",
  "remote_host": "server3",
  "private_key": "/opt/keys/deployment_key"
}
```

**Security Notes:**
- Ensure private key files have correct permissions (600)
- Keep private keys secure and never share them
- Use different keys for different environments (dev/staging/production)

## Usage

Once configured, you can use the following capabilities through your AI assistant:

### Tools

  "private_key": "~/.ssh/production_key"
}
```

#### `SSH Sudo` (Remote Command Execution with Sudo)

Executes a command on a remote POSIX compatible system (Linux, BSD, macOS) system via SSH. This tool **permits** commands to be run with sudo for administrative tasks.

**Parameters:**
- `command` (required): The command to execute (can include sudo)
- `args` (optional): Array of arguments to pass to the command
- `remote_host` (required): The hostname or IP address of the remote system
- `remote_user` (optional): The username to connect as (defaults to current user)

  "remote_user": "admin"
}
```

```json
{
  "command": "sudo",
  "args": ["tail", "-f", "/var/log/syslog"],
  "remote_host": "logserver",
  "remote_user": "sysadmin"
}
```

**Using a custom private key with sudo:**

```json
{
  "command": "sudo",
  "args": ["systemctl", "restart", "apache2"],
  "remote_host": "web01.example.com",
  "remote_user": "admin",
  "private_key": "/home/user/.ssh/admin_key"
}
```

#### `Copy_File` (File Transfer with Rsync)

Copies a file from the local machine to a remote system using rsync. This tool automatically preserves file attributes (permissions, timestamps, ownership) and creates backups of existing files on the remote system.

**Parameters:**
- `source` (required): The path to the source file on the local machine
- `destination` (required): The destination path on the remote machine
- `remote_host` (required): The hostname or IP address of the remote system
- `remote_user` (optional): The username to connect as (defaults to current user)
- `private_key` (optional): Path to the private key file for authentication (defaults to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
- `timeout_seconds` (optional): Timeout in seconds for the copy operation (default: 30, set to 0 to disable)

**Features:**
- **Archive mode**: Preserves permissions, timestamps, ownership, and other file attributes
- **Automatic backups**: If a file exists at the destination, a backup is created with a `~` suffix
- **Secure transfer**: Uses SSH for encrypted file transfer

**Examples:**

```json
{
  "source": "/home/user/config.yaml",
  "destination": "/etc/myapp/config.yaml",
  "remote_host": "webserver.example.com",
  "remote_user": "deploy"
}
```

```json
{
  "source": "./build/app.jar",
  "destination": "/opt/myapp/app.jar",
  "remote_host": "production-server",
  "remote_user": "deploy",
  "private_key": "~/.ssh/deployment_key",
  "timeout_seconds": 60
}
```

**Using with absolute paths:**

```json
{
  "source": "/var/www/html/index.html",
  "destination": "/var/www/html/index.html",
  "remote_host": "backup-server",
  "private_key": "/opt/keys/backup_key"
}
```

**Backup Behavior:**
When copying to an existing file, rsync creates a backup with the original filename plus a `~` suffix:
- Original file: `/etc/myapp/config.yaml`
- Backup file: `/etc/myapp/config.yaml~`
- New file: `/etc/myapp/config.yaml` (updated)

#### `Patch_File` (Apply Patches to Remote Files)

Applies a patch/diff to a file on a remote system via SSH. The patch content is streamed through stdin over the SSH connection to the remote `patch` command. This tool is ideal for applying code changes, configuration updates, or bug fixes to remote files without transferring the entire file.

**Parameters:**
- `patch` (required): The patch/diff content to apply (unified diff format recommended)
- `remote_file` (required): The path to the file on the remote machine to patch
- `remote_host` (required): The hostname or IP address of the remote system
- `remote_user` (optional): The username to connect as (defaults to current user)
- `private_key` (optional): Path to the private key file for authentication (defaults to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
- `timeout_seconds` (optional): Timeout in seconds for the patch operation (default: 30, set to 0 to disable)
- `options` (optional): Additional SSH options to pass via `-o` flag (array of "key=value" strings)

**Features:**
- **Stdin streaming**: Patch content is securely streamed via SSH stdin
- **Automatic strip detection**: The `patch` command automatically detects the appropriate `-p` strip level
- **Unified diff support**: Works best with unified diff format (`diff -u` or `git diff`)
- **Context preservation**: Maintains file context for accurate patching

**Examples:**

**Basic usage:**
```json
{
  "patch": "--- config.yaml\n+++ config.yaml\n@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@\n-port: 8080\n+port: 9090\n",
  "remote_file": "/etc/myapp/config.yaml",
  "remote_host": "webserver.example.com",
  "remote_user": "deploy"
}
```

**Applying a Git diff:**
```json
{
  "patch": "diff --git a/app.py b/app.py\nindex 1234567..abcdefg 100644\n--- a/app.py\n+++ b/app.py\n@@ -10,7 +10,7 @@ def main():\n-    return 'Hello'\n+    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
  "remote_file": "/opt/myapp/app.py",
  "remote_host": "production-server",
  "remote_user": "appuser",
  "private_key": "~/.ssh/deployment_key"
}
```

**With custom SSH options:**
```json
{
  "patch": "--- nginx.conf\n+++ nginx.conf\n@@ -5,1 +5,1 @@\n-worker_processes 2;\n+worker_processes 4;\n",
  "remote_file": "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf",
  "remote_host": "192.168.1.100",
  "remote_user": "root",
  "options": ["StrictHostKeyChecking=no", "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null"]
}
```

**Typical Workflow:**
1. Generate a diff locally: `diff -u original.txt modified.txt > changes.patch`
2. Read the patch content
3. Use `Patch_File` to apply it to the remote file
4. Verify the changes with `SSH` tool (e.g., `cat /path/to/file`)

**Important Notes:**
- The `patch` command must be installed on the remote system
- Ensure the file to be patched exists on the remote system
- If the patch fails to apply cleanly, check the output for conflicts
- The remote file path should be absolute or relative to the remote user's home directory
- For large patches or binary files, consider using `Copy_File` instead

**Common Patch Formats:**
- **Unified diff** (recommended): `diff -u old.txt new.txt`
- **Git diff**: `git diff file.txt`
- **Context diff**: `diff -c old.txt new.txt`

### Resources

This server exposes local system information as resources that can be read by the AI assistant.

#### `public_keys`

Lists all available public keys (`.pub` files) found in the user's `~/.ssh` directory.

**URI:**
`file:///public_keys`

**Returns:**
A comma-separated string of public key filenames.

**Example Usage:**
An AI assistant might read this resource to see which SSH keys are available for use in the `SSH` or `SSH Sudo` tools, especially when deciding which `private_key` to specify.

**Example Return Value:**
`id_rsa.pub,id_ed25519.pub,work_key.pub`

## Timeout Configuration

All commands support configurable timeouts to prevent indefinite blocking.

- **Default**: 30 seconds
- **Disable**: Set `timeout_seconds` to `0`
- **Custom**: Set any positive integer (seconds)

### Examples

```json
// Quick command
{
  "command": "whoami",
  "remote_host": "server1",
  "timeout_seconds": 5
}

// Long operation
{
  "command": "find",
  "args": ["/", "-name", "*.log"],
  "remote_host": "server1",
  "timeout_seconds": 300
}

// No timeout (monitoring)
{
  "command": "tail",
  "args": ["-f", "/var/log/syslog"],
  "remote_host": "server1",
  "timeout_seconds": 0
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **SSH Key Security**: Use strong SSH keys and keep private keys secure
- **Limited Scope**: Only grant access to systems you trust the AI to manage
- **User Permissions**: The remote user should have appropriate but limited permissions
- **Monitoring**: Consider logging SSH sessions for audit purposes
- **Network Security**: Ensure SSH is properly configured (disable password auth, use non-standard ports, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure SSH keys are properly set up and the user has access
2. **Host Key Verification Failed**: Add the host to your known_hosts file:
   ```bash
   ssh-keyscan -H remote-host >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
   ```
3. **Command Not Found**: Ensure the command exists on the remote system and is in the PATH

### Common SSH Issues

- **Connection Timeout**: Check network connectivity and SSH daemon status
- **Authentication**: Verify SSH key permissions (600 for private key, 644 for public key)
- **Path Issues**: Use absolute paths for commands when possible

### Private Key Issues

1. **Wrong Key Path**: Ensure the `private_key` parameter points to the correct file:
   ```bash
   # Check if key exists
   ls -la ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

   # Verify key permissions
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

2. **Key Not Added to Agent**: If using SSH agent, ensure your key is loaded:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ssh-add -l  # List loaded keys
   ```

3. **Multiple Keys**: When using multiple keys, specify the correct one:
   ```json
   {
     "command": "whoami",
     "remote_host": "server",
     "private_key": "~/.ssh/specific_key"
   }
   ```

4. **Key Format Issues**: Ensure your private key is in the correct format (OpenSSH format preferred)

## Development

To modify or extend this server:

1. Edit the source code in `src/lib.rs`
2. Add new tools by implementing functions with the `#[tool]` attribute
3. Rebuild with `make build`
4. Restart your MCP client to pick up changes

### Testing
